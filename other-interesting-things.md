- important to have in-person meeting/kickoff for distrubuted teams
- for improving culture, important to do both:
  - grass roots
  - go up flagpole and have manager support+approval
- shopify had the culture in place years before he joined
- saw attempts at improving culture fail bc if only tackle from one angle, usually gets squashed or rejected
- VR team that does whiteboard sessions in VR room, can see others and interact with their avatars
